# sPCtrum
Photo scanner tool, used to change colors of new and exisiting images to make them more accesible to people with colorblindness. Winner of PCHacks 2019 Best First Time Hacker Group Award!

# What it does
Our demo app allows the user to input an image by either uploading an existing photo or by taking a photo on the spot. The app then filters the image to make it easier for people with Deuteranomaly, a type of red-green colorblindness, to see the color green. Our demo app currently only have the option of assisting people with Deuteranomaly, but we hope to expand the line of filters to suit the needs for all types of colorblindness. 

# Tech Stack
The app was developed in Android Studio and we utilised the OpenCV Java libraries to help with the image processing portion of our project.
